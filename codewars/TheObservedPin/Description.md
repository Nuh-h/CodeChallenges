# The Observed Pin (https://www.codewars.com/kata/5263c6999e0f40dee200059d)

A person observed someone entering a pin code into a door with the keypad looking like this:

```
┌───┬───┬───┐
│ 1 │ 2 │ 3 │
├───┼───┼───┤
│ 4 │ 5 │ 6 │
├───┼───┼───┤
│ 7 │ 8 │ 9 │
└───┼───┼───┘
    │ 0 │
    └───┘
```
They noted the PIN 1357, but they also said, it is possible that each of the digits they saw could actually be another adjacent digit (horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally). E.g. instead of the 1 it could also be the 2 or 4. And instead of the 5 it could also be the 2, 4, 6 or 8.

They also mentioned, they knows this kind of locks. You can enter an unlimited amount of wrong PINs, they never finally lock the system or sound the alarm. That's why we can try out all possible (*) variations.

* possible in sense of: the observed PIN itself and all variations considering the adjacent digits

Can you help us to find all those variations?
