## Solution in C# for "Permutations" Kata (Kyu 4) from https://www.codewars.com/kata/5254ca2719453dcc0b00027d

### Problem:

*In this kata you have to create all permutations of an input string and remove duplicates, if present. This means, you have to shuffle all letters from the input in all possible orders.*

* Permutations.singlePermutations("a") `should be` ["a"]
* Permutations.singlePermutations("ab") `should be` ["ab", "ba"]
* Permutations.singlePermutations("aabb") `should be` ["aabb","abab","abba","baab","baba","bbaa"]

*The order of the permutations doesn't matter.*
